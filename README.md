# Income-Predictor-Machine-Learning---Neural-Network-

This project is implemented using backpropogation algorithm from scratch using python. 
This project predict income for a adult (above 50 K or below 50K )using different parameters like age,place, education, number of years of experience etc. 

Language used : python 3 and above
Version : python 3 or abvove


# Required libraries: 

If you don't have Python on your computer, you can use the Anaconda Python for installation of the ython packages.

libraries using :
NumPy: Provides a fast numerical array structure and helper functions.
pandas: Provides a DataFrame structure to store data in memory and work with it easily and efficiently.

To make sure you have all of the packages you need, install them with conda:

conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

conda may ask you to update some of them if you don't have the most recent version. Allow it to do so.


# The problem Statemet:
This project is help to find effictive path from source to the destination . This project uses heuristic to find optimal way and give preference to Direction
